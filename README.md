# CanSat Arduino Sketches 

During a time periode from 2012 to 2015 a student class in Technology and Ressearch at KVT (Kristen Videregående skole, Trøndlag) joing the Andøya Space Senter at Andøya, Norway. A team of students from the class attended to a CanSat competition where the goal was to launch a device inside an empty Coca Cola can by rocketry 2 km up in the atmosphere. On the way down the can was conneted to a paracute and recorded different environment parametres like height, pressure, temp and other parametres back  to a PC operator by telemtry. In this github a collection of different Arduino sketches are stored for record. There are sketches that support GPS, IMU and FreeRTOS.
